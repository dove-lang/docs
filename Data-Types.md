## Data Types

### Booleans
There are two boolean literals: `true` and `false`.

Every Dove value is either truthy or falsey, so that they can be used like a boolean in a logic operation.

Dove follows Ruby's simple truthiness rule: `false` and `nil` are falsey, and everything else is truthy.

### Numbers
There is only one numeric type in Dove: double precision floating-point number which is 64 bits in size.
```

-12.345
```

### Strings
String literals starts and ends with `"`.
```
"Hello World"
```
